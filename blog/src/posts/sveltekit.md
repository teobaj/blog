# My Blog using Svelte Kit

Right now the blog is work in progress. I got the ispiration from Joy of code.

So far I can add new blog posts writing them as Markdown files inside posts dir.

## TO DO:

- ~~be able to search posts by category~~
- ~~add about and contact pages~~
- ~~add theme switcher using skeleton themes~~
- ~~add page transitions~~
